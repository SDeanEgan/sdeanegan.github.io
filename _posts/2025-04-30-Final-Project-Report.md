## Final Project Report

To expand myself as a computer science professional I took on a project to learn a new programming language. I chose Rust, a general-purpose language that emphasizes safety and performance. This meant committing time each week to reading about new features, then providing a report like this one on how they could be implemented. 

I originally decided to explore Rust for its reputation. Rust had its first production release about ten years ago, and since then has progressively developed in popularity. Despite its relatively young age, the language has cultivated a wonderful, vocal community that professes its strengths and prioritizes inclusion. Rust has also grown a reputation for being challenging. Despite this I have come to believe that a better label to describe Rust would be "progressive" rather than "hard." 

When first setting out, there was some uncertainty about where to begin. Rust is not my first programming language, but would be the first I took on independently. There exists a number of competing attitudes about how best to learn a new language. I decided that what would work best for me was to use a preexisting text that I could break up as needed. This would give as much material to learn as I might need, and make it easier for me to create more involved status posts to document progress. 

The real success of the project has been in selecting *The Rust Programming Language* to learn from. Of the introductory programming language texts I have read, it is likely the best. Language used is both welcoming and accessible, and overall length is very reasonable for the goal of covering as much of Rust as possible. Better still, [the enhanced version offered by Brown University](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) included additional quiz questions which provided review throughout sections and "Ownership Inventories" which took the form of interactive tests at the end of key chapters. Originally, weekly status posts were a limited check-in as project choices were being made, but eventually these grew to become a more advanced materials review. Throughout reading *The Rust Programming Language* coding project chapters are provided that give hands-on coding opportunities. In addition to these, the project also came to develop several further coding examples which supported weekly posts by illustrating new concepts. [All of the coding done for the project was collected into a GitHub repository for convenience.](https://github.com/SDeanEgan/rust-lang.book) 

As for results, the key goals provided in the project's initial proposal have all been successfully completed. The book and additional quizzes are finished, and the project chapters have been presented. Although lessons presented in status posts are too numerous to list off here, there are some key lessons which deserve mentioning. The first is what makes Rust safe. The answer is much more than "lots of checks at compile time." This is important for appreciating how to think in terms which take full advantage of the language's best benefits. The second is how Rust is distinct from other languages. This is not necessarily clear from reading *the book* by itself, and ought to be considered by anyone who wants their Rust experience to benefit them when they code in other languages. This benefit can serve in both directions. Third, what prevents Rust from being a first language. There may come a day where Rust is considered as good of a first language as any other, but the challenges it has now deeply influence the meta - from how common it is to what kind of programmers are using it. Reaffirming answers for these questions was especially helped by the opportunity to discuss them directly through the piazza forums with other students during the project. 

Outcomes were not perfect, however. Initial commitments were accomplished and posts developed to become better with time, but some stretch goals failed to come together. The key among these being an extra, self-devised coding project after book material. An initial plan for a game that ran through WebAssembly proved too temperamental, and making a text editor like nano proved too big for the remaining time - this did lead me to learn a lot from [the amazing kibi text editor project](https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi). Also, a mistake when projecting the reading schedule also led to consuming an extra week to make up for the async Rust chapter, a new addition not found in older versions of *The Rust Programming Language*. Some of these issues were largely bad luck, or a lack of new ideas on my part. Given another chance I would have tried reaching out to the Rust community for ideas directly, which I expect would have yielded better results. 
 
The experience has significantly influenced my view of programming languages. Before, I might have been convinced that many modern programming features are not all that important, or okay to just do without. Now that I have had this chance to learn Rust I feel really excited to take advantage of them, and even seek out how I can translate them into code I might produce in other languages. This might be more easily maintained code through typing in Python, or more systematic error handling through return value wrappers in modern C++. I certainly plan to keep going with Rust, though. I have every expectation this language will only continue to gain momentum. Moving forward, I plan to read [Effective Rust](https://effective-rust.com/) to get better rounded with intermediate, idiomatic Rust. During which I want to keep working toward a long term coding project. The challenge will feel worth-while, and there's a growing community out there to share it with.
