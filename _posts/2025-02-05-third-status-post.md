## Third Status Post

We're past "Hello, World!" now. The project has properly started, and I'm enjoying the progression so far. 

Last week saw the first three chapters of *the book*, which got rust installed along with the accompanying tools like rustup and cargo. These are the version manager and package builder, respectively. Chapter three covered a number of the language basics; think flow control and basic types. But what helped to illustrate these basics the most was the simple, command line guessing game project provided in chapter two. [I've made sure to provide a copy of that project via this repository](https://github.com/SDeanEgan/rust-lang.book), which I'll use to keep the rest of the text's projects also. This was a fun way to get exposure to a bunch of rust's concepts like immutability by default, pattern matching, and how strings work. A few final updates were also made to the blog here, to get things ready to present in the next week. 

This week I'll be covering chapters four, five, and six. The first of these introduce the ownership system of rust for handling references, one of the more complex charateristics of the language. Also, more involved components like structs, enums, and match expressions. After chapter two I expect to especially get use out of match expressions while learning (think of them as something of a modern, safer take on a switch). Within the next week I'm also expecting to receive project feedback from my course, which may encourage some structural changes or additions for me to make to the process. 

For now, I'm staying committed and waiting for that feedback, though I'm not expecting anything crazy to shake up what I'm currently doing. Another delay this week involved a dropped ssh connection between one of my machines and github. This was minor but still consumed time which could have gone to the project work itself, and has led me to engage in some git tutorials and review which I'll be doing in conjunction. I may not actually need much git for the remainder, but that will help me get out in front of potential further issues. 

All in all I'm expecting the upcomming weeks to be very straight-forward. Depending on time demand, I'll look into additional resources from the community.
