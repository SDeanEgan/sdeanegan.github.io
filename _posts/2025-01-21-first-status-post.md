## First Status Post

This January I started a professional development course with CU Boulder, where I am currently earning a Bachelor of Science. This makes for the first of many posts serving as an update on my progress. The general form takes from the typical status update format for stand-up meetings (or scrums) found in the Agile project management methodology. This can keep updates concise, although to add some nicety I'll try and work the formatting into prose in the future. The course focuses students on a major project of our own development. As a consequence much of the early effort will be in determining what my project will actually be.

 - what did you do last week?

Last week I did my best at soul searching. It isn't easy to analyze your own short-commings, especially in a subject like computer science where there can be so many competing methods for qualifying a professional's capabilities. The course itself offers a wide variety of examples, however. One option I considered was to give back to community. I spent some time looking into [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) as they have always had worthwhile pursuits. Volunteering with them or organizing through them could have been a good option, but would have had me a bit out of my depth and involved a bit of risk for whether or not a project would even get off the ground. I still recommend to anyone who's interested to consider a donation or even using their site to engage with the "action center" page they offer. At this point I'm planning to commit to a more techincal choice. I'm thinking of learning the Rust programming language, and building a project to showcase some of its features. 

 - what do you plan to do this week?

This week will be investigating Rust and potential project ideas. It's a compiled language, which would be good for a number of options which practice system knowledge or perhaps data structures. This would be good for me as it's been some time since I've worked on a project in this area. I plan to explore existing project ideas from github users or the Rust subreddit. 

 - are there impediments in your way?

The main impediment for me right now is my total lack of familiarity with Rust. I recently took the principals of programming languages course with CU, and I'm hoping I can apply some of that to get moving smoothly with the new language. I'll need to select the actual project itself carefully to make sure not to overextend or underdeliver. 

 - how can you make the process better from the last week's process?

When learning new things I tend to be fairly liberal with my time. This can create a lack of focus which I'll need to work against as I move forward with my project. I intend to use more scheduling this time to help with the journaling process and keep a consistent progression.
