## Second Status Post

Another week has gone by and a lot has happened!

Last week I searched around for Rust learning resources and did some preliminary reading via [the extensive Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). To anyone considering Rust I highly recommend [the Rust 101 presentation video by Emily Dunham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rust_101.webm). It was made in 2017, and presents the ambitions and tools of the language well. The Rust community has developed a few great first choices for newcomers and it was necessary for me to drill down into these a bit in order to make a best guess about density and time demand. I've decided on *The Rust Programming Language*, as it's on the healthier side in terms of volume, and features some projects which illustrate Rust's values. In conjunction I've also written out a proposal to formalize my rationale, which features the timeline I'm currently committing to in order to complete the material by late April.

This week I'll be taking direction via my development course in order to improve my plan, and I'll be diving into the first three chapters of *the book*. This will include the small introductory project in chapter 2, which I will be completing and will make available on Github. The project itself is a command line guessing game provided by the text in order to get a feel for the language. I'll take the time to discuss some of the things I learn there in the next post.

A lot of the challenge to determining my commitments and completing the proposal came from the uncertainty of co-opting an existing resource or curriculum while trying to adhere to the time constraint imposed by my course. However, now that my objectives have been blocked out I'm free to dig in. I'll be learning the right pacing in these upcoming weeks, but moving forward I feel unhindered.

Now that my process will be changing over from searching for resources to following along with one I need to buckle down on keeping weekly objectives. This will mean covering book material with an appropriate amount of leeway for the coding. Either way, I'm very excited to be moving into the project proper.
