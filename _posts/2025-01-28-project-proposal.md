## Project Proposal

---

#### Vision Statement

To support my development as a computer scientist I have chosen to expand to a new programming language, Rust. Although it may be possible in some cases to take on a new language quickly and easily, Rust stands as a particularly complex and challenging choice. In order to give myself the best opportunity to take on this challenge I have decided to use the Klabnik, Nichols text *The Rust Programming Language* as my introduction. 

Referred to by the community as "the book", *The Rust Programming Language* also exists [as a more richly featured version offered by Brown University](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), which I intend to use specifically in order to take advantage of its additional quiz questions and visualizations. Completing *the book* will strengthen my ability to write safe, efficient, and reliable systems-level code. Working through the bookâ€™s projects will give me hands-on experience with real-world applications, from building command-line tools to writing a simple web server, reinforcing my understanding of systems programming, concurrency, and performance optimization. Mastering Rust will expand my professional skill set, allowing me to contribute to high-performance applications in fields like web development, embedded systems, and cloud computing. By completing this book, I will develop a deeper knowledge of low-level programming while using a modern, safe language that is increasingly in demand.

#### Motivation

Learning Rust is a great way to rediscover and expand systems knowledge because it forces you to think carefully about memory management, concurrency, and performance, but without sacrificing modern programming conveniences. Unlike languages like C or C++, Rust is both highly performant and memory-safe. This makes it a top contender for a good long-term choice of compiled language, even if it is considered to be more difficult to learn. By working through Rust's unique features, I stand to gain a stronger grasp of how computers manage memory, CPU usage, and parallel execution, which ultimately will make me a more capable programmer. Additionally, there is something to be said for the community which uses and supports Rust. The Rust community is known for being welcoming, supportive, and focused on collaboration. It emphasizes inclusivity, with well-documented resources, and active forums that can help newcomers like me. The Rust community presents itself as something I would like to become a part of. 

#### Specific and Measurable Goals

| Week #       | Objectives                                                 |

| Week 8       | Chapters 14, 15                                            |
| Week 9       | Chapters 16, 17                                            |
| Week 10      | Chapters 18, 19                                            |
| Week 11      | Spring Break                                               |
| Week 12      | Chapter 20 / Final Multithreaded Web Server Project        |
| Week 13      | Final Project Completion / Flex-time                       |
| Week 14      | Final Project Completion / Flex-time                       |
| Week 15      | Submit Final Report                                        |

The predominate responsibility will be completing the reading for the twenty chapters. The book's three projects are to be completed on the week in which that chapter is to be covered. 

#### Risks to Project Completion

There are several risks that could impact project completion, as this marks my first experience learning Rust and will involve limited weekly hours. The biggest challenge is the steep learning curve, especially with Rust's unique systems for handling memory usage such as ownership and borrowing. If concepts like these take longer to grasp, it may slow down progress. Another risk is underestimating the time needed to complete quiz questions and projects because the additional effort required for them will vary. Certain chapters - specifically the "project chapters" 2, 12, and 20 - require hands-on coding, and deeper analysis, which may take more time than we are intended to alot. Limited weekly hours mean there is less flexibility to absorb complex topics, revisit concepts, or fix mistakes. 

#### Mitigation Strategy

The main strategy for mitigating the completion risks will be to adhere to the organizational timetable for the proposal. This will break down weekly objectives so that they can be kept to as consistent of a block of required time as possible, while maintaining the desired goal of comprehensively covering the book's material and including additional flex-time for covering cases where an earlier week's objectives went unfinished. 

#### Project Assessments

 - Answer the available quiz questions
 - Read the entirety of the book
 - Finish and present the three included book projects
 - Submit a final report on how things went and potential follow-up choices to continue developing Rust

The project's greatest strength is its simplicity; once all the text's materials have been covered it is complete.
